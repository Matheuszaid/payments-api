## Supported Versions

## PCI DSS Compliance Statement

### Scope Declaration

This payment API is designed to be **PCI DSS out-of-scope** by architectural design:

- **No Cardholder Data (CHD)**: This system does not store, process, or transmit cardholder data
- **Webhook-Only Architecture**: Receives only payment event notifications from certified PCI DSS compliant providers (Stripe, PayPal)
- **No Card Processing**: Direct card transactions are handled exclusively by PCI-certified payment processors

### Data Classification

#### Data We Handle:
- **Payment Event Metadata**: Transaction IDs, amounts, timestamps, status
- **Webhook Signatures**: For authenticity verification
- **Application Logs**: For monitoring and debugging (no sensitive data)

#### Data We Do NOT Handle:
- Primary Account Numbers (PANs)
- Card verification values (CVV/CVC)
- Expiration dates
- Cardholder names
- Billing addresses
- Any other Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)

### Architecture Security

- **Event-Driven**: Processes only post-transaction webhooks
- **Stateless Processing**: No persistent cardholder data storage
- **Encrypted Communication**: All webhook endpoints use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic verification of all incoming webhooks

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@yourcompany.com
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30-90 days depending on complexity

### Security Measures

This API implements multiple security layers:

#### Application Security
- **Webhook Signature Verification**: HMAC-SHA256 validation for all providers
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized using Pydantic schemas
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate processing of events
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information disclosure

#### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Non-Root Container**: Docker containers run as non-privileged user
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and monitoring

#### Development Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with pip-audit, safety, bandit
- **Static Code Analysis**: CodeQL and Bandit security analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy image vulnerability scanning
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets, environment-based configuration

#### Operational Security
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all webhook processing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed events captured for analysis
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and alerting
- **Backup & Recovery**: Database backup strategies for business continuity
